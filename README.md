### TODO

Rails作为一个全栈式web框架，适合于开发web应用，但是如果使用Rails提供API接口，
Rails太过于重量级，同时，使程序的性能下降。GGA框架通过ActiveRecord提供数据持久化，
通过Grape提供HTTP路由，通关Goliath作为web服务器，可以提供更加轻量级，响应迅速，
高并发的API服务。

As a full-stack web framework, Rails is the best choice for developing web applications.
But if you use Rails as the API interfaces, Rails is too heavyweight that it will reduce
the program's performance.
GGA framework provided more lightweight, fast response, high concurrency API services
through the ActiveRecord provided data persistance, the Grape provided HTTP route,
the Goliath as a EventMachine web server.
